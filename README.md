## 0. About this specification

This is the official HSSP specification, licensed under the [MIT License](LICENSE). All dates are in ISO 8601 format (YYYY-MM-DD). If a MurmurHash3 checksum is used, it always uses the number `822616071` (decimal) as seed.

## 1. Introduction

HSSP is designed to support huge file sizes while being way better than other container formats like ZIP, RAR, etc.

## 2. Versions

HSSP has multiple versions, each with different features.

### 2.1. HSSP v1 (Wrongfolder/WFLD)

| Release date |
| :----------: |
|  2023-03-14  |

Wrongfolder is the first version of HSSP. It's called Wrongfolder, because @Le0X8 published a wrong folder of the first HSSP implementation in JavaScript ([&rarr; official JavaScript library](https://github.com/HSSPfile/js)).

#### 2.1.1. Features

- Storing files
- Content encryption
- Integrity check
- "Index file" (you can define a main file of the package)

#### 2.1.2. File structure

The file structure of Wrongfolder is very simple. It consists of a 64 byte [header](#2121-header) and a [body](#2122-body).

##### 2.1.2.1. Header

| Offset | Length | Description                                                            |   Type   |
| :----: | :----: | :--------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------: |
|  0x0   |  0x4   | Magic value: `SFA\x00`                                                 |  UTF-8   |
|  0x4   |  0x4   | MurmurHash3 checksum of the [body](#2122-body) (files)                 | Uint32LE |
|  0x8   |  0x4   | Number of contained files                                              | Uint32LE |
|  0xC   |  0x20  | Password hash (double SHA-256) (filled with 0x0 if no password is set) |          |
|  0x2C  |  0x10  | Initialization vector (IV) (filled with 0x0 if no password is set)     |          |
|  0x3C  |  0x4   | "Index file" (main file of the package, e. g. a README)                | Uint32LE |

##### 2.1.2.2. Body

The body consists of multiple files.

A file is structured like this:

|  Offset   | Length | Description                                                                          |   Type   |
| :-------: | :----: | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------: |
|    0x0    |  0x8   | File length in Bytes (= FL)                                                          | Uint64LE |
|    0x8    |  0x2   | Name length in Bytes (= NL)                                                          | Uint16LE |
|    0xA    |   NL   | Name of the file (if the file starts with `//`, the file will be parsed as a folder) |  UTF-8   |
|  0xA+NL   |   FL   | File contents (if the file is a folder, this will be ignored.)                       |          |
| 0xA+NL+FL |   NL   | Unused. You can put anything here.                                                   |          |

##### 2.1.2.3. Encryption

The encryption is done with AES-256-CBC. The password is hashed with SHA-256 and the result is hashed again with SHA-256. The result is the key.

When encrypting, you have to encrypt the whole body.

### 2.2. HSSP v2 (Rightfolder/RFLD)

##### 2.4.3.3. Body

The body consists of multiple files.

A file is structured like this:

| Offset | Length | Description   | Type |
| :----: | :----: | :------------ | :--: |
|  0x0   |   ?    | File contents |      |

### 2.5. HSSP v5 (Flagged/FLGD)

| Release date |
| :----------: |
|  2023-08-24  |

HSSP Flagged is a small, but important update to HSSP Indexed. It adds flags to determine if compression, encryption, splitting, etc. is used, which makes HSSP more robust because "hash equal to zero" bugs cannot happen anymore.

"Hash equal to zero" bugs happend when a parser thought that the file is not encrypted, because the password hash was equal to zero. This is not possible anymore, because the parser can now check securely if the file is encrypted.

##### 2.5.2.4. Body

The body consists of multiple files.

A file is structured like this:

| Offset | Length | Description   | Type |
| :----: | :----: | :------------ | :--: |
|  0x0   |   ?    | File contents |      |

### 2.6. HSSP v6 (Separated/SPRD)

| Release date |
| :----------: |
|  2023-08-31  |

This update is another big update to HSSP. It separates the index and the files, which opens possibilities for multithreaded parsing
for a massive performance boost, because files can now be decrypted and decompressed at the same time.

Because of the new chaining feature, the file structure is now much more complex than before, but because this feature, the file generation is now much more flexible.

#### 2.6.1. New features

- Index and files are now encrypted and compressed separately, also every chain now has its own checksum
- Calculation of the index length is now required
- File chaining (files can now be chained for encryption and compression) to bundle multiple files together

#### 2.6.2. Removed features

- Flags F9-F24 because they were unused
- HSSP v4 compression codes because they were longer than they should be

#### 2.6.3. File structure

##### 2.6.3.4. Body

The body consists of multiple files.

A file is structured like this:

| Offset | Length | Description   | Type |
| :----: | :----: | :------------ | :--: |
|  0x0   |   ?    | File contents |      |

### 2.7. HSSP v7 (Cryptography Update/CRYP)

| Release date |
| :----------: |
|    soon!     |

This large update adds the option to use a different encryption algorithm than AES-256-CBC, signing, asymmetric encryption support and native support for [Acridotheres WebAuth](https://acridotheres.com/plus/webauth) as well as better header organization & even more checksums to verify integrity even better.

> [!WARNING]
> HSSP7 has a very different header structure compared to the previous versions.

### 2.7.1. New features

- Added support for different encryption algorithms
- Added support for signing
- Added WebAuth support
- Added support for multiple compression & encryption algorithms in one file
- Optimized header structure
- Comments are optional and can be up to 65536 bytes long
- Generator credits are now replaced by a generator ID (e. g. `acridotheres.com` &rarr; `0x4163`) and can be optional (by setting the ID to `0x0`).

### 2.7.2. Start Header

The archive starts with a 9 byte header.

| Offset | Length | Description                 |   Type   |
